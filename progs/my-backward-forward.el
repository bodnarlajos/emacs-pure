;;; Commentary:
;; Summary:
;; this package provides eclipse-like forward/backward navigation
;; bound by default to <C-left> (backward-forward-previous-location)
;; and <C-right> (backward-forward-next-location)
;;
;; More Info:
;; backward-forward hooks onto "push-mark" operations and keeps
;; track of all such operations in a global list of marks called backward-forward-mark-ring
;; this enables easy navigation forwards and backwards in your history
;; of marked locations using <C-left> and <C-right> (or feel free to change the keybindings).
;;
;; Many Emacs commands (such as searching or switching buffers with certain packages enabled)
;; invoke push-mark.
;; Other Emacs commands can be configured to invoke push mark using the system below:
;;      (advice-add 'ggtags-find-tag-dwim :before #'backward-forward-push-mark-wrapper)
;;  You can see examples of the above convention below.
;;
;; Use C-h k to see what command a given key sequence is invoking.
;;
;; to use this package, install though the usual Emacs package install mechanism
;; then put the following in your .emacs
;;
;;    ;(setf backward-forward-evil-compatibility-mode t) ;the line to the left is optional,
;;          ; and recommended only if you are using evil mode
;;    (backward-forward-mode t)

(define-minor-mode backward-forward-mode
  "enables or disable backward-forward minor mode.

when backward-forward mode is enabled, it keeps track of mark pushes across
all buffers in a variable backward-forward-mark-ring, and allows you to navigate backwards
and forwards across these marks using <C-left> and <C-right>.  to customize
the navigation behavior one must customize the mark pushing behavior --
add 'advice' to a command to make it push a mark before invocation if you
want it to be tracked.  see backward-forward.el for examples and more
information.
