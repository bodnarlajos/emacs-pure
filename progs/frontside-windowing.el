;;; Commentary:

;; Make window navigation consistent and intuitive.

;; 1. It's annoying when you're using a lot of multi-window flows and commands
;; that render their output in a separate window are constantly either
;; splitting horizontally, or sometimes they open above, or sometimes they
;; open three or four splits at a time.  Instead, you want the same
;; splitting behavior for the same UI workflow no matter what the
;; screen size.

;; This makes the split super simple and thereby consisent by always
;; splitting horizontally by half.

;; 2. Add keybindings so that window navigation works similar to tabbed navigation
;; 3. Aesthetic fixes such as removing double-rendered scroll bars

;;; Code:

(define-minor-mode frontside-windowing-mode
  "Make window splits dead simple and consistent"
  :keymap (let ((keymap (make-sparse-keymap)))
         (define-key keymap [remap split-window-below] #'frontside-windowing--vsplit-last-buffer)
         (define-key keymap [remap split-window-right] #'frontside-windowing--hsplit-last-buffer)
         keymap)
  (if frontside-windowing-mode
      (frontside-windowing-on)
    (frontside-windowing-off)))
